Title: MediDB

Description:
	This project is intended to model and implement the Admit/Discharge/Transfer functions of a medical database.
	We will create an Entity Relationship Diagram of the necessary entities and then implement a database that
	can store those entities correctly.  If possible, we will also implement a small Database Management System
	in the form of a transaction processor that can process delimited strings of data and store them in this
	database as well.
	Medical Databases must track the admission of all patients, as well as their location within the hospital, and
	their eventual discharge.  Each patient will have their information stored in the database.  Each admission 
	will start a new visit which will have an admit date and time.  During that visit, The patient can only have one 
	location, though that location can change a number of times.  There is no need to keep track of the room change 
	history.  At the end of their visit	they will be discharged, and the visit will be updated with a discharge date 
	and time.
	In order to do this, our database must maintain a list of hospitals, a list of locations within each hospital, 
	and a list of employees and which hospitals they work at. It kust be able to maintain a list of patients, and 
	a list of visits for those patients.  Each hospital must have a name, physical address, mailing address, billing
	address, billing phone number, patient care phone number, and human resources phone number.  Each Location within
	a hospital must have a name, and optionally may include a ward (or location group) identifier.  Each Employee
	must have a name, a mailing address, a contact phone number, 
	The ERD should contain the following entities: Patient,
	The Database will be impleneted via MySQL
	Any DBMS we implement will be written in C#
